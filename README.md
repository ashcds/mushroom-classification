# Mushroom Classification

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous. The classification is performed using neural networks and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

## Project Overview

Mushroom classification is a critical task in ensuring safety when identifying edible mushrooms. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to achieve accurate classification.

## Key Features

- **Neural Networks**: Used for building a robust classification model.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Applied for feature reduction to improve model performance and reduce computational complexity.

## Dataset

The dataset contains various features of mushrooms, such as cap shape, color, and odor. Each mushroom is labeled as either edible or poisonous.

## Project Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing:
    - Handle missing values.
    - Encode categorical features.
2. Feature Reduction:
    - Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality.
3. Model Training:
    - Train a neural network on the processed data.
4. Evaluation:
    - Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

## Results

The results of the model, including accuracy and visualizations, will be documented here.

## Future Work
